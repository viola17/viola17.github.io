    I graduated from  <a href=https://illinois.edu/>UIUC</a> double-majoring in <a href=https://math.illinois.edu/>maths</a> and <a href=https://stat.illinois.edu/>stats</a>. 
    After that, I interned at <a href=http://www.abc-ca.com/gywm/CProfile.shtml?id=cpfl/>ABC-CA Fund Management</a> as a risk analyst and also worked at <a href=https://www.moseeker.com/>MoSeeker, Inc.</a>, a human resource tech firm, as a python engineer.I came back to pursue an <a href=https://analytics.georgetown.edu/>M.S. in Data Science and Analytics</a> at Georgetown University because of its ability to tackle real-world complex problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have now accomplished Massive Data Fundamentals, Optimization and Statistical Computing in which I practiced R and Python a lot for modeling. This fall, I will sharpen my skills in data visualization, relational database systems&SQL programming, and deep learning through more classes. I am currently working on a Viginia Census Stimulation project as a Research Assistant with Professor Brodnax. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My past experiences have continued to increase my fascination with the comprehensive applications of data science and statistical methods. As such, I aspire to become a data scientist who integrates computational techniques with statistical theories to analyze products, markets and risks. I am currently seeking spring 2021 internships and full-time positions post May 2021.

<li><p>(in progress) <strong>Virginia Census Simulation,<a href ="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/the-massive-data-institute/"> Massive Data Institute Scholars Program</a> </strong></p></li>

<p>This project involves linking, deduplicating, and modeling commercial and administrative data for the state of Virginia to compare to the 2020 decennial census counts. </p>

</p>
<p>
  Multi-Dwelling Units (MDUs) are housing estates, such as apartment complexes, consisting of individual residences. Electricity use is monitored by a bulk meter which measures the total load for the entire MDU. The bulk meter records average power readings over 30 minute intervals which are used for billing and analysis of usage patterns. This project aims at training and analyzing predictions models, based on <a href="https://github.com/viola17/viola17.github.io/tree/master/projects/powerdata">bulk meter readings and weather info</a> between 10.14.2018 and 10.13.2019, that accurately forecast future electricity usage.

  According to the Bizzabo Blog, 41% marketers believe that “events are the most effective marketing channel over digital advertising, email marketing and content marketing.” Event-directed marketing strategies increased by 32% since 2017. Event holders might be wondering what factors are indispensable for hosting a successful event. We did the research for the marketers by exploring 6544 events and their surrounding businesses, transportations in New York State, and analyzed features categorized into theme, time, space and cost separately.

<p>
  <em>Yizhi Fang, Matt Welch, Jiamin Zhong, Jonathan Pickett</em>
</p>
<p>
   Can a "dangerous" city actually provide safe study enviroment? Are "rich" cities safer? To answer these questions, we used FBI arrest dataset, median income by state dataset and campus crime dataset to analyze the relations between safety level of each campus to that of its surrounding cities. First, we looked into the crime data in the cities surrounding campuses and compared that with on campus weapon, drug, alcohol violations across the States in 2010. Next, We explored how crime rates, adjusted on a population level, relate to the median income levels of each state. Check <a href="https://github.com/viola17/viola17.github.io/tree/master/projects/crimecode">code and datasets</a> to see how we merged crime datasets by State and City and printed the least safe universities and summed the data on a state level to merge with the median income data by Sate.

<p>
  Employees leave a company for variety of reasons, but some can be controlled. Is the low salary really the main reason that leads to high turnover rate? With careful data analysis and modeling, this project revealed that important factors that influence the turnover rate are usually satifaction level, workload and performance. We also provided useful suggestions to managers who want good employees to stay!

<li><p><strong><a href="projects/AutomataandSpaceFillingCurveReport.pdf">Automata and Space-Filling Curves</a></strong> </p></li>
<p>
<em>Ruoyu Meng, Ziqin Xiong, Hughes Lu, Jiamin Zhong</em>
</p>
<p> 
  In the last few years, novel connections between mathematical logic, automata theory and metric geomery have emerged. The goal of this project is to determine whether graphs of space-filling curves can be recognized by an automation, in a similar way where ternary representations in which the digit 1 does not occur of elements of a usual middle-thirds Cantor set C can be recognized by an automation.
